# IBM-Model-1

A baseline is cloned from https://github.com/alopez/en600.468.git

The repository contains some code and a dataset of 100,000 English-French sentence pairs ('hansards.e' and 'hansards.f'). The first 37 sentence pairs are manually aligned, and these manual alignments are encoded in file 'hansards.a'. It provides a very simple baseline system using the Dice coefficient.

Baseline for 1000 sentence pairs with Dice coefficient:
Alignment Error Rate (AER) = 0.680

Improvement with IBM Model 1:
AER = 0.371
